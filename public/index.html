                The situation India faces is different. While people are quick to criticise the government for the
                prolonged lockdown, stating that it has not fully succeeded in saving lives or the economy, they forget
                the conditions under which many people live in this country. For instance, people who live in slums
                cannot maintain social distancing or the hygiene required to protect against the virus. Dharavi is a
                case in point. Also, in a country which has struggled to maintain order and discipline (owing largely to
                its massive population), locking down 1.3 billion people proved to be essential in its fight against
                Covid-19. Sweden could afford different measures. India could not.</p>

        <h2>Brief about Corona </h2>

        <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
            recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
            cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
            illness.

            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease
            it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an
            alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
            person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
            coughing into a flexed elbow).

            At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing
            clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
            clinical findings become available.
